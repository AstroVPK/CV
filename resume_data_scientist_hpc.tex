\noindent \emph{Imaginative former astrophysicist with a passion for building numerical software that hides high-performance computing behind a friendly UI.}
\\
\\
Having fallen in love with Astronomy at the age of four, I was spurred by my family to follow my passion for astrophysics, mathematics, \& computing.

Coming from a {\large \sc gw basic} background in high-school, I learned {\large \sc idl} to search for non-Gaussianity in the Cosmic Microwave Background for my senior research project at the University of Richmond (2005). My {\large \sc idl} skills found application developing an automated image-analysis pipeline for studying the oxygen etching of silicon surfaces while obtaining my Master's degree at Virginia Commonwealth University (2007).

After beginning my doctorate at Drexel University, I used a variety of techniques, including machine learning with neural nets, to quantify the accuracy with which the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will measure galactic distances. The sheer volume of data generated by NASA's {\it Kepler} mission led to me programming Intel's Xeon Phi accelerator cards to study the variability of Active Galactic Nuclei for my PhD dissertation (2015).

My first postdoc with the \href{http://dm.lsst.org/}{LSST project} exposed me to the challenges of developing a high-performance software stack (15 TB/night over 10 years of raw data, \CPP \ \& Python, 50+ developers) in a professional Agile software development environment with an emphasis on algorithmic correctness \& coding standards. At the same time, working with \href{http://www.physics.upenn.edu/people/standing-faculty/adam-lidz}{Adam Lidz} at Upenn, I extended my \CPP \& Python package \href{https://github.com/AstroVPK/kali}{\textsc{k\={a}l\={i}}} to analyzing periodically-beamed stochastic light curves generated by dual black-hole systems in distant galaxies.

Bitten by the high-performance computing (HPC) bug, I recently began a research engineer position at a Si valley company, Colfax International, that provides HPC software consulting to a broad swath of clients from industry.
